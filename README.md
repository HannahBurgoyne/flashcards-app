# Welcome to Flashcards! 
This project allows a user to create and use their own custom flashcards. I originally built this in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in week 6 of Foundations at Dev Academy Aotearoa, and then recreated the entire project as a fullstack application in week 7 of Bootcamp. 

--------
### Tech stack:
- Node.js
- React
- ReactQuery
- TypeScript
- CSS
- Knex
- SQLite3
- Express
- Superagent
- Vite

-----
### Status: 
Currently, a user can: 
- Add a new deck of custom flashcards (using a dynamic form of any length)
- Test their knowledge by using existing decks of flashcards in the deck library
- Edit and delete existing flashcards
- Delete an entire deck and all its flashcards 

------

### Learnings (so far!): 
- How to incorporate JavaScript logic (particularly getElementById and onClick) into React and ReactQuery
- Prop drilling state management in React
- Creating many-to-many relationships between databases
- Querying many-to-many relational databases
- How to add a dynamic form in React (and submit dynamic data!)
- Refactoring previous work
- Improving UX 
- Working with the framer-motion animation library
